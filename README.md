My name is Hasan Hüseyin Şenay. I was born on November 28, 2009 in the Tire town of Izmir. I graduated from Tire Rasih Kirazoğlu Elementary School and Tire Fatih Secondary School. I started high school at Izmir Bornova Anatolian High School. Later, I passed to Tire Belgin Atila Çallıoğlu Science High School. I am a 9th class student of Tire Belgin Atila Callioglu Science High School right now. I have worked on C, C#, Java and Python programming languages since 2021. I have developed many games using the Unity game engine. I participated in the World Robot Olympiad 2024 tournament, whose topic is "Earth Allies", together with two other friends. In May of 2024, I participated in a game jam called "EğitiJam 2024" together with three other friends and made it to the finals. I am currently working on website development. Have a nice day!
